============================================================
Welcome to The Specialists Beta 2.0 (www.specialistsmod.net)
============================================================

The Specialists team, started 2 years ago by Morfeo and John_Matrix’s direction wanted and wants to create a mod for the great, 
famous and best-seller Half-Life, in which there are two primary objectives for the team to reach: Action movies’ gameplay style
but also credible realism, both for guns and their damages.Firefights, depending from the various gameplays that will be listed, 
will be both spectacular due to our “stunt” moves as well as spectacular for a new implemented particellar system, 
new muzzle flashes and weapons' realistic power. Players can shot down an enemy just with a burst of 9mm as well as a single shotgun shot.
Users will be able to choose if behave as an “action man” (use of light equipment, small caliber guns) taking advantage of their agility 
or behave as a “specialist” using large caliber weapons, which affect agility but improve firepower. It’s also possible to close any 
encounter with an headshot, which is, almost in all cases, lethal… But now don’t stay here, take a look to all “The Specialists” (TS from now on) new features!

IMPORTANT: FOR ALL INFO WATCH THE TSMANUAL INTO The Specialists DIRECTORY (TS/TSmanual) OR VISTIT The Specialists Website (www.specialistsmod.net).
