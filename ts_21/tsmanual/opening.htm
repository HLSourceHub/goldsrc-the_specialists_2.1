        pounding, heart hammering, you sprint along the corridor, the metal of 
        the pistol cold against your hand. As you emerge in to the bright lights 
        of the deserted station, you breathe a sigh of relief. Not far to go now.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#e6e6e6"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As 
        you run underneath the overpass towards the stairs the silent station 
        suddenly erupts with gunfire, the stone floor around you is sprayed with 
        bullets. You dive for cover, swinging round in time to see him leaping 
        from the top of the overpass. As he lands and flows smoothly into a forward 
        roll, you dive towards him, firing. Time seems to slow down all around 
        you, so much so that you can almost see the bullets gliding through the 
        air, drifting towards their target. He dives to the side, narrowly dodging 
        all your fire. You land as he does, both coming to a halt, lying flat 
        on the floor a few feet away from each other.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#e6e6e6"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>You 
        quickly get up, ejecting the empty magazine from your gun, you slam the 
        new one home just as he leaps at you, catching your arm and kicking the 
        gun away. You duck and kick, sending him staggering back. As he recovers, 
        you stare in to his eyes and take your stance. He runs forward, launching 
        himself into the air....10 feet....20 feet up. You don't have time to 
        be amazed; you dive backwards, desperately reaching for your fallen gun. 
        He plummets towards you, fist raised to strike. Your hand finds the gun 
        and grips it, you bring it bear and pull the trigger as fast as you can. 
        For a brief moment you think you see what looks like surprise on his face, 
        before the hail of bullets catch him in the head and chest, spraying blood 
        over you as his body flies back under the impact.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#e6e6e6"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>There 
        is silence for a few moments, punctuated only by the sound of your heart 
        beating. Shaking, you slowly get up and make your way to the stairs, sparing 
        only a glance for the slack body of your fallen adversary, dropping the 
        spent magazine and reloading as you go.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
