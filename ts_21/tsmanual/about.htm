        Specialists (TS) is a modification for Valve's infamous first-person shooter, 
        Half-Life. It is a real fusion of ideas, taking inspiration from such 
        famous Hollywood movies as Face/Off &amp; The Matrix, mixed with the Hong 
        Kong Blood Opera style of directors such as John Woo. All of this is added 
        to classic yet innovative deathmatch &amp; teamplay gametypes and mixed 
        with an arsenal of realistic weapons, real freedom of movement, a great 
        selection of maps and serious amounts of carnage. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#e6e6e6"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>All

        These are maps with specific objectives where the players are split into 
        two teams. Players must complete the task that has been set for them, 
        or prevent the other team from completing theirs. These tasks vary and 
        may include scenarios such as bomb-defusal or computer hacking.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

        Modes</font></strong></em></P>
      <P><font color="#e6e6e6" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As well as standard deathmatch, TS incorporates several 
        other modes of play:</font></P>
      <P><font color="#e6e6e6" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
        One Mode</strong>: At the start of the map, one player is randomly selected 
        as 'The One'. This player has to defend him or herself against all other 
        players. When The One is killed, the person who killed them becomes The 
        One, and so on. In order to help you survive, The One automatically receives 
        a kung-fu, a superjump powerup, as well as a health bonus for every enemy 
        killed. Added to this, he gets a free Slowpause powerup and is impossible 
        to disarm.</font></P>
      <P><font color="#e6e6e6" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Last 
        Man Standing</strong>: All players spawn on a map and fight to the death. 
        No respawning is allowed until one player has emerged victorious over 
        the rest.</font></P>
